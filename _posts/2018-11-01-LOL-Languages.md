This is an overview of the current languages available *by default* on the major operating systems. Some language, as for example `sed`, have been omitted, because I consider it would be hard to write tools in that language.

Basically this list gives me an overview of all the languages I should learn to survive on vanilla installations of OSes.

Python, Perl or Ruby seem the way to go to survive both on macOS and Ubuntu (I personnaly prefer Python).

Next, you would have to pick one for Windows. I would go with Powershell as it seems to be the most powerfull one.

I think it is also impressive how many languages are installed by default on a macOS.

| Language | Windows 10 | MacOS Mojave | Ubuntu 18.04 |
|----------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| Python | | x | x |
| Perl  | | x | x |
| Ruby |  | x | x |
| PHP  | | x | | 
| Bash | | x | x | 
| Zsh | | x | |
| Awk | | x | x |
| Tcl/Tk | | x | |
| Applescript | | x| |
| Batch | x | | |
| PowerShell | x | | |
| Javacript/JScript | x| x | |
| VBScript | x | | |
