Hello everbody,

Welcome to my site, which runs on GitHub pages and Jekyll, whic hare both awesome.

If you are into creating your own static blog, I can recommand them both.

GitHub pages lets you create your own *.github.io page (as for example "b3n7s.github.io" in my case). This way you don't have to mess with paying hosting companies for hosting your website. You can even put your own (payed) domain name over it if you want! Something I don't do, as I'm a cheap ass.

Next we have Jekyll. Jekyll is a gem actually, so you will need Ruby. It lets you set up your blog site in a few minutes with easy commands. All is perfectly explained at their site.

You can use Git to update to work on your site at your computer and update it towards your GitHub repository.

Have a nice stay!
